# Camera Calibration Optimization

## Purpose/Motivation
The files within in this package are designed to optimize a linear and nonlinear camera projection. The nonlinear method takes distortion into account. The goal is to find the set of parameters that align best with the predicted set of points generated by the model.

## optimization-nonlinear
Description: This model takes radial and tangential distortion into account which adds four additional parameters/coefficients to our model.

## optimization-linear
Description: This model does not take distorition into account, but provides a simple example of what the nonlinear method was intended to do.
